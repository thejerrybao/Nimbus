          <p class="lead">Whether you’ve been here before or you’re brand new, we are unbelievably excited to have you! We truly have a diverse array of events for you-- from serving the homeless, tutoring children, cleaning up the environment, and more! You can continue your passion for service throughout college, while also developing your professional skills from public speaking to leading an event! Furthermore, we have a family system and socials for you to meet new people!</p> 
          <p class="lead">Circle K is a place you can call home-- I know I sure do. It combines things I love to do with people I love to be with. If it’s all too much to take in right away, don’t get overwhelmed! I came into Circle K with no Key Club background, but it didn’t matter! My first two events (Big C Hike & Rebuilding Together) introduced me to some truly genuine people with a passion for doing good. Flashforward a few years, and Circle K has proven to be a huge part of my college experience and life! Through Circle K i’ve gained some of my closest friends, professional skills, and irreplaceable memories.</p>
          <p class="lead">Seize this moment! Sign up for an event, attend a committee meeting, come to a social, or even drop by our table on Sproul during one of your awkward schedule gaps. We’re always happy to see you!  </p>
